# MultiAgentSys
A multi agent system that makes use of the capabilities of agents in an e-commerce scenario

The systems aim is to provide a user friendly alternative to the current manual process of e-commerce interactions (buying/selling) by
making efficient use of the Agents capabilities to tackle each negative aspect of the current system, such capabilities include:

    1. Communication and coordination between agents to achieve mutual goals.
    2. Decision making (to make decisions on behalf of user)
    3. Autonoumsy, to behave indepentaly of user interactions.


To view the source code navigate to VersionControl\AgentSysBETAv1.5 (this should allow you to view the main method, to view all clases 
navigate to AgentSysBETAv1.5\src\org\eclipse\wb\swing). I would strongly suggest viewing the source code in Eclipse 
or any other IDE as it will be more friendly.

This repositary includes all files as part of the system, whether these are database files, XML file, or simply imnported libraries

I strongly suggest reading or scimming through the project documentation to get an ideal of the design and implmentation decision made and 
the reasoning behind them.

The system is written in Java, the use of Java is justified within the documentation.
